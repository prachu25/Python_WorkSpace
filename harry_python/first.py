print('''Under the sun, on fields so wide,
Bats and balls in rhythm collide.
The bowler runs with eyes of flame,
A battle begins — the glorious game!

The willow sings, the crowd does roar,
A boundary lights the scoreboard’s core.
Fielders dive, their hearts so true,
Chasing dreams in shades of blue.

Rain or shine, they never tire,
Their spirits burn with endless fire.
From gully streets to stadium fame,
Cricket unites — it’s more than a game!''')
